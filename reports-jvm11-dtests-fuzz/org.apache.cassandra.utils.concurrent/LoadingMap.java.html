/**
 * An extension of {@link NonBlockingHashMap} where all values are wrapped by {@link Future}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The main purpose of this class is to provide the functionality of concurrent hash map which may perform operations like
 * {@link ConcurrentHashMap#computeIfAbsent(Object, Function)} and {@link ConcurrentHashMap#computeIfPresent(Object, BiFunction)}
 * with synchronization scope reduced to the single key - that is, when dealing with a single key, unlike
 * {@link ConcurrentHashMap} we do not lock the whole map for the time the mapping function is running. This may help
 * to avoid the case when we want to load/unload a value for a key K1 while loading/unloading a value for a key K2. Such
 * scenario is forbidden in case of {@link ConcurrentHashMap} and leads to a deadlock. On the other hand, {@link NonBlockingHashMap}
 * does not guarantee at-most-once semantics of running the mapping function for a single key.
