    /**
     * Construct a minimal list of overlap sets, i.e. the sections of the range span when we have overlapping items,
     * where we ensure:
     * - non-overlapping items are never put in the same set
     * - no item is present in non-consecutive sets
     * - for any point where items overlap, the result includes a set listing all overlapping items
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * For example, for inputs A[0, 4), B[2, 8), C[6, 10), D[1, 9) the result would be the sets ABD and BCD. We are not
     * interested in the spans where A, B, or C are present on their own or in combination with D, only that there
     * exists a set in the list that is a superset of any such combination, and that the non-overlapping A and C are
     * never together in a set.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Note that the full list of overlap sets A, AD, ABD, BD, BCD, CD, C is also an answer that satisfies the three
     * conditions above, but it contains redundant sets (e.g. AD is already contained in ABD).
     *
     * @param items            A list of items to distribute in overlap sets. This is assumed to be a transient list and the method
     *                         may modify or consume it. It is assumed that the start and end positions of an item are ordered,
     *                         and the items are non-empty.
     * @param startsAfter      Predicate determining if its left argument's start if fully after the right argument's end.
     *                         This will only be used with arguments where left's start is known to be after right's start.
     *                         It is up to the caller if this is a strict comparison -- strict (&gt;) for end-inclusive spans
     *                         and non-strict (&gt;=) for end-exclusive.
     * @param startsComparator Comparator of items' starting positions.
     * @param endsComparator   Comparator of items' ending positions.
     * @return List of overlap sets.
