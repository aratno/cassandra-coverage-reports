/**
 * Represents a sliced view of a trie, i.e. the content within the given pair of bounds.
 *
 * Applied by advancing three tries in parallel: the left bound, the source and the right bound. While the source
 * bound is smallest, we don't issue any content and skip over any children. As soon as the left bound becomes strictly
 * smaller, we stop processing it (as it's a singleton trie it will remain smaller until it's exhausted) and start
 * issuing the nodes and content from the source. As soon as the right bound becomes strictly smaller, we finish the
 * walk.
 *
 * We don't explicitly construct tries for the two bounds; tracking the current depth (= prefix length) and transition
 * as characters are requested from the key is sufficient as it is a trie with just a single descent path. Because we
 * need the next character to tell if it's been exhausted, we keep these one position ahead. The source is always
 * advanced, thus this gives us the thing to compare it against after the advance.
 *
 * We also track the current state to make some decisions a little simpler.
 *
 * See Trie.md for further details.
