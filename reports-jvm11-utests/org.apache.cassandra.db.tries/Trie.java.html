/**
 * Base class for tries.
 *
 * Normal users of tries will only use the public methods, which provide various transformations of the trie, conversion
 * of its content to other formats (e.g. iterable of values), and several forms of processing.
 *
 * For any unimplemented data extraction operations one can build on the {@link TrieEntriesWalker} (for-each processing)
 * and {@link TrieEntriesIterator} (to iterator) base classes, which provide the necessary mechanisms to handle walking
 * the trie.
 *
 * The internal representation of tries using this interface is defined in the {@link Cursor} interface.
 *
 * Cursors are a method of presenting the internal structure of a trie without representing nodes as objects, which is
 * still useful for performing the basic operations on tries (iteration, slicing/intersection and merging). A cursor
 * will list the nodes of a trie in order, together with information about the path that was taken to reach them.
 *
 * To begin traversal over a trie, one must retrieve a cursor by calling {@link #cursor()}. Because cursors are
 * stateful, the traversal must always proceed from one thread. Should concurrent reads be required, separate calls to
 * {@link #cursor()} must be made. Any modification that has completed before the construction of a cursor must be
 * visible, but any later concurrent modifications may be presented fully, partially or not at all; this also means that
 * if multiple are made, the cursor may see any part of any subset of them.
 *
 * Note: This model only supports depth-first traversals. We do not currently have a need for breadth-first walks.
 *
 * See Trie.md for further description of the trie representation model.
 *
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The content type of the trie.

    /**
     * A trie cursor.
     *
     * This is the internal representation of the trie, which enables efficient walks and basic operations (merge,
     * slice) on tries.
     *
     * The cursor represents the state of a walk over the nodes of trie. It provides three main features:
     * - the current &quot;depth&quot; or descend-depth in the trie;
     * - the &quot;incomingTransition&quot;, i.e. the byte that was used to reach the current point;
     * - the &quot;content&quot; associated with the current node,
     * and provides methods for advancing to the next position.  This is enough information to extract all paths, and
     * also to easily compare cursors over different tries that are advanced together. Advancing is always done in
     * order; if one imagines the set of nodes in the trie with their associated paths, a cursor may only advance from a
     * node with a lexicographically smaller path to one with bigger. The &quot;advance&quot; operation moves to the immediate
     * next, it is also possible to skip over some items e.g. all children of the current node (&quot;skipChildren&quot;).
     *
     * Moving to the immediate next position in the lexicographic order is accomplished by:
     * - if the current node has children, moving to its first child;
     * - otherwise, ascend the parent chain and return the next child of the closest parent that still has any.
     * As long as the trie is not exhausted, advancing always takes one step down, from the current node, or from a node
     * on the parent chain. By comparing the new depth (which &quot;advance&quot; also returns) with the one before the advance,
     * one can tell if the former was the case (if newDepth == oldDepth + 1) and how many steps up we had to take
     * (oldDepth + 1 - newDepth). When following a path down, the cursor will stop on all prefixes.
     *
     * When it is created the cursor is placed on the root node with depth() = 0, incomingTransition() = -1. Since
     * tries can have mappings for empty, content() can possibly be non-null. It is not allowed for a cursor to start
     * in exhausted state (i.e. with depth() = -1).
     *
     * For example, the following trie:
     *  t
     *   r
     *    e
     *     e *
     *    i
     *     e *
     *     p *
     *  w
     *   i
     *    n  *
     * has nodes reachable with the paths
     *  &quot;&quot;, t, tr, tre, tree*, tri, trie*, trip*, w, wi, win*
     * and the cursor will list them with the following (depth, incomingTransition) pairs:
     *  (0, -1), (1, t), (2, r), (3, e), (4, e)*, (3, i), (4, e)*, (4, p)*, (1, w), (2, i), (3, n)*
     *
     * Because we exhaust transitions on bigger depths before we go the next transition on the smaller ones, when
     * cursors are advanced together their positions can be easily compared using only the depth and incomingTransition:
     * - one that is higher in depth is before one that is lower;
     * - for equal depths, the one with smaller incomingTransition is first.
     *
     * If we consider walking the trie above in parallel with this:
     *  t
     *   r
     *    i
     *     c
     *      k *
     *  u
     *   p *
     * the combined iteration will proceed as follows:
     *  (0, -1)+    (0, -1)+               cursors equal, advance both
     *  (1, t)+     (1, t)+        t       cursors equal, advance both
     *  (2, r)+     (2, r)+        tr      cursors equal, advance both
     *  (3, e)+  &lt;  (3, i)         tre     cursors not equal, advance smaller (3 = 3, e &lt; i)
     *  (4, e)+  &lt;  (3, i)         tree*   cursors not equal, advance smaller (4 &gt; 3)
     *  (3, i)+     (3, i)+        tri     cursors equal, advance both
     *  (4, e)   &gt;  (4, c)+        tric    cursors not equal, advance smaller (4 = 4, e &gt; c)
     *  (4, e)   &gt;  (5, k)+        trick*  cursors not equal, advance smaller (4 &lt; 5)
     *  (4, e)+  &lt;  (1, u)         trie*   cursors not equal, advance smaller (4 &gt; 1)
     *  (4, p)+  &lt;  (1, u)         trip*   cursors not equal, advance smaller (4 &gt; 1)
     *  (1, w)   &gt;  (1, u)+        u       cursors not equal, advance smaller (1 = 1, w &gt; u)
