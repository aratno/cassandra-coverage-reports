     * states (STOP_SIGNALLED, STOPPED, AND SPINNING) and two working states: WORKING, and (ASSIGNED), the last
     * being represented by a non-static instance with its &quot;assigned&quot; executor set.
     *
     * STOPPED:         indicates the worker is descheduled, and whilst accepts work in this state (causing it to
     *                  be rescheduled) it will generally not be considered for work until all other worker threads are busy.
     *                  In this state we should be present in the pool.descheduled collection, and should be parked
     * -&gt; (ASSIGNED)|SPINNING
     * STOP_SIGNALLED:  the worker has been asked to deschedule itself, but has not yet done so; only entered from a SPINNING
     *                  state, and generally communicated to itself, but maybe set from any worker. this state may be preempted
     *                  and replaced with (ASSIGNED) or SPINNING
     *                  In this state we should be present in the pool.descheduled collection
     * -&gt; (ASSIGNED)|STOPPED|SPINNING
     * SPINNING:        indicates the worker has no work to perform, so is performing a friendly wait-based-spinning
     *                  until it either is (ASSIGNED) some work (by itself or another thread), or sent STOP_SIGNALLED
     *                  In this state we _may_ be in the pool.spinning collection (but only if we are in the middle of a sleep)
     * -&gt; (ASSIGNED)|STOP_SIGNALLED|SPINNING
     * (ASSIGNED):      asks the worker to perform some work against the specified executor, and preassigns a task permit
     *                  from that executor so that in this state there is always work to perform.
     *                  In general a worker assigns itself this state, but sometimes it may assign another worker the state
     *                  either if there is work outstanding and no-spinning threads, or there is a race to self-assign
     * -&gt; WORKING
     * WORKING:         indicates the worker is actively processing an executor's task queue; in this state it accepts
     *                  no state changes/communications, except from itself; it usually exits this mode into SPINNING,
     *                  but if work is immediately available on another executor it self-triggers (ASSIGNED)
